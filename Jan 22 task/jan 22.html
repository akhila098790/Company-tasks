        The project is intended to develop a Hexacopter fitted with a video camera.
        The Hexacopter can be used for surveillance purpose. This gadget is designed
        to help the campus security monitoring. The Hexacopter can reach the areas
        where security personnel cannot physically reach. This device can be used
        to monitor and control the student discipline during College working hours.
