    <h2> Harry potter legacy </h2>
    <p> The Harry Potter films and their success have been retrospectively
         considered to have had a significant impact on the film industry. 
         They are credited with helping redefine the Hollywood blockbuster in the 21st century 
         by initiating a shift toward established media franchises forming 
         the basis of successful films. In the wake of the final film's release,
          Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that the films
           "inspired every major studio to try to capture [its] alchemic formula,
            spawning a range of copycats and wannabes" and "also have shown Hollywood
             how to make a glossy blockbuster with an eye toward keeping costs down"</p>
