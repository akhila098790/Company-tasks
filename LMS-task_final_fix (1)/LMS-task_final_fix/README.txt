Run (Recommended):
- Open folder in VS Code
- Start Live Server on index.html

Why Live Server?
- The site loads data/content.json using fetch(). Many browsers block local-file fetch due to CORS.

Pages:
- index.html, courses.html, course.html, lesson.html, editor.html, glossary.html, search.html

Content database:
- data/content.json

Images:
- Real visuals are stored as SVG files in assets/visuals/ and referenced by lessons.
- You can replace any SVG with PNG/JPG and keep the same filename.
